Here are some quick tips to help you be more productive with npm.

## npm outdated

Use this to see any module dependencies that are out of date. This can get kind
of ugly though so specify the depth to see only your outdated dependencies (and
not the dependencies of your dependencies).

    $ npm outdated --depth 0

## npm link

The link command creates a symbolic link to a module on your machine. Use this
to easily consume modules that you are working on. You can also link a global
module to your path when working on a command line module.

To use a local module, change to the directory of your project and run

    $ npm link /path/to/module

You will then have access to that module from your project.

## npm version <version>

Use npm version to update the version of your module. This will update the
package.json version for the module and commit the change.

    $ npm version 0.1.1

## Shortcuts

npm has some helpful shortcuts to make your life easier, here are some common
ones.

    $ npm i      # short for npm install
    $ npm i -S   # short for npm install --save
    $ npm i -D   # short for npm install --save-dev
    $ npm i -g   # short for npm install --global
    $ npm r      # short for npm uninstall
